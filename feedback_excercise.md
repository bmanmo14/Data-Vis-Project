### Comments and Feedback:
What years are you going to include?
Suggestion - Specific date feature, Somebody wants to look at a specific year for a country, more easily see trends for a certain country. Maybe look into brushing for a specific year range. Doing this may make it easier to see dataset, zoom into that point.

Where is the data coming from?
Data is coming from two different datasets.

Good amount of detail and interactivity, any more may affect the layout and visualizations in an unexpected way.
Risk adding to many widgets, it becomes too overwhelming.
